                Unemployment is defined as the state of someone who doesnâ€™t have a job. It is something society is suffering from right now, especially with the coronavirus (COVID-19), the whole country is under quarantine restrictions and regulations. With the pandemic, many jobs have unfortunately laid off employees due to the stay at home orders, leaving many people without money to adhear to basic necessities.

              <p> Unemployment affects everyone, whether you are self-employed or just a regular employee. In the United States, the government uses surveys, census counts...etc to track unemployment. Tracking unemployment is very important because we need to know what we need to fix in out country. Without being able to track unemployment we wouldnt be able to know how many jobs we need to create.</p>
